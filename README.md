# Wordfish (beta)

Interesting insights and charts about the usage of certain words/phrases/topics or activity in a discord channel over time.
Flexible options like only including specific roles, proportional charts, changing time intervals. More features hopefully coming soon!

## Examples
*(for obvious reasons, the legend (usernames) are hidden in these examples)*

An example for monthly activity from (mostly) 5 people:

Searching for the word "bad" by week:

## Invite:

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1094453223278002259&permissions=117760&scope=bot

*Permissions:*
+ Read Messages / View Channels (Only public)
+ Send Messages
+ Embed Links (needed for the message format)
+ Attach Files (needed for the images)
+ Read Message History (needed to access channel data)

Once added, if Wordfish is online (I'm currently hosting on a home laptop lmao), run `::help` in your server!

*To scan channels invisible to `@everyone` Wordfish must be manually given those permissions.*

## Issues

**This bot is still in beta - report any issues with GitHub's issues feature. (or dm me on discord you probably know me since this is a beta release)**
